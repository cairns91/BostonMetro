# BostonMetro

Group Project, The aim of this project was to design and implement a multi-graph ADT and to use the multi-graph to model the Boston Metro System in a program that is able to provide directions to passengers on how to get from one station to another. Main focus was on design/ implementation of the front-end, interfaces and the decoupling of the system.
